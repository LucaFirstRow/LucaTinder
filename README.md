This app has been designed on backend by Spring boot. The app has a layer model which consists of layer DAO, Services and Controller. In addition, inside the controller layer Rest Services have been developed with the goal of answering different clients proposals, including request from different Frontend models.
To prove this feature, we have created a main frontend in Html, Css and Thymeleaf and a second front implemented Angular.

The app has been tested in each of its phases carrying out some unitary tests and integrating its components. 

To develop this project we have used Agile methodology such as sprint and kanban, which has allowed us to develop the project in a total of 5 sprint being simulated in periods of 2 or 3 days. On the other hand, we have used git for the control of the versions and in this repository the final result can be found.

The best app to find your reall love. with this app you can find a person that like your personal hobbit and you can star a new realaccion with them.
